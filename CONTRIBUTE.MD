## Intro

To begin, thanks for your thoughts on contributing!

If you have found an issue or would like to request a new feature, simply create a new issue detailing the request. I also welcome pull requests with an open mind. See below for info on getting started with development and submitting pull requests.

## Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help by
submitting an issue to my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/iBz-04/Dashboard-starter/issues/new).
Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix or solution.

## Development Workflow

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Run dev server

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Commit Message

Your commit message should:

- start with a verb so that I can easily read your commit message this way: "This commit will ..."
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add support for dark mode"
